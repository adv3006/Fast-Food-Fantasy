# FastFoodFantasy

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/adv3006/Fast-Food-Fantasy.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/adv3006/Fast-Food-Fantasy)

## CS1D First Project - 2016
1. Made by Eagle Eye - a team of four members
2. Used Qt (version 5.5) - a cross-platform application framework to provide graphical user interface in c++
3. Used Scrum - an agile framework for software development
4. Used Travis - a hosted, distributed continuous integration service during the developing process

### Description:
A program that allow foodie (food lover) starting at Saddleback College to plan various day trips. Foodie must be able to randomly access the various fast food restaurants, including a list of the fast food restaurants, plan a trip, and take a trip. This is not an exhaustive list.

### About the Scrum process
* There were three sprints total during the development
* A total of 12 agile stories (including description, tasks, test scenarios, and story points) were writen before the software is developed
* Definition of __Done__: Completion of the user story or at least 50% of the story including a graphical user interface (if required)

### For more details, please go to the Eagle Eye's artifacts

#### Note: Feel free to fork this project however if you're taking CS1D, I don't recommend doing that for two main reasons:
* This project uses an old version of Qt and sqlLite and I won't update it.
* Academic Dishonesty, resulting an F for the course.
